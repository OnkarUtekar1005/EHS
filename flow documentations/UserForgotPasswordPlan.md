# User Forgot Password Issue Analysis and Plan

## Current Implementation

The EHS Learning Platform has a multi-step forgot password flow:

1. **Request Password Reset**:
   - User enters email on `/forgot-password` page
   - Frontend sends request to `/api/auth/forgot-password` API endpoint
   - Backend generates a token, saves it to the database, and sends an email with reset link
   - For security, frontend always shows success message regardless of whether email exists

2. **Token Validation**:
   - User clicks link in email, which navigates to `/reset-password?token={token}`
   - Frontend validates token via `/api/auth/reset-password/validate`
   - If valid, shows password reset form; if invalid, shows error

3. **Password Reset**:
   - User enters new password (with confirmation)
   - Frontend sends request to `/api/auth/reset-password` with token and new password
   - Backend validates token again, updates user password, and marks token as used
   - Frontend redirects to login page on success

## Identified Issue

When a user clicks the reset link in the email and attempts to set a new password, they receive the error:
- "Error: Password is required" with 400 status code in the API response.

## Analysis

Based on the code review, the issue seems to be related to how the password reset data is sent to the backend:

1. **Frontend Implementation (ResetPassword.js)**:
   - The frontend is sending the following data to the API:
     ```javascript
     await authService.resetPassword({
       token,
       password: passwords.password
     });
     ```

2. **Backend Implementation (AuthController.java)**:
   - The backend expects a JSON object with `token` and `password` fields.
   - It performs validation checks:
     ```java
     if (password == null || password.isEmpty()) {
         return ResponseEntity.badRequest()
             .body(new MessageResponse("Error: Password is required"));
     }
     ```

3. **API Service (api.js)**:
   - Contains debug logs showing payload being sent:
     ```javascript
     console.log('Reset password payload:', JSON.stringify(resetData, null, 2));
     ```

The error suggests that either:
1. The payload structure is incorrect
2. The password value is not being properly sent in the request
3. The backend is not properly parsing the request body

## Action Plan

1. **Debug Request/Response**:
   - Enhance frontend logging to capture exact payload and response
   - Verify token format and structure in console logs

2. **Test Password Reset Flow**:
   - Run controlled test of the reset password flow
   - Capture all request/response pairs

3. **Fix Implementation**:
   - Update ResetPassword.js to ensure correct payload structure
   - Verify proper error handling in the UI

4. **Test Solution**:
   - Verify complete flow from email request to password reset
   - Document testing process and results

## Implementation Steps

1. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Add additional debugging in ResetPassword.js to log complete request/response cycle
   - Ensure password field is correctly named and populated in request

2. **Test End-to-End Flow**:
   - Request password reset for a test account
   - Use token from console logs to test reset page
   - Monitor network requests during form submission

3. **Implement Fix**:
   - Based on testing results, update resetPassword function in ResetPassword.js
   - Add additional validation if needed

4. **Verify Solution**:
   - Run the complete flow to ensure it works correctly
   - Test with various password combinations
