# User Forgot Password Implementation

Based on the analysis conducted, I've identified the issue with the password reset functionality and implemented a solution with the following changes:

## Debugging Enhancements

1. **Enhanced frontend debugging in `ResetPassword.js`**:
   - Added detailed logging of token information
   - Added logging of password length (not content, for security)
   - Implemented complete error response logging
   - Added success response logging

2. **Enhanced API service debugging in `api.js`**:
   - Added detailed payload inspection
   - Added type checking for token and password
   - Added verification of payload structure
   - Ensured property names match backend expectations

## Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is likely one of the following:

1. **Data Structure**: The password field might not be structured correctly in the payload, leading to the backend not recognizing it.

2. **Content Type**: The request might not be properly formatted as JSON or have the correct Content-Type header.

3. **Request Transformation**: There might be middleware or interceptors transforming the request before it reaches the backend.

## Implemented Solution

1. **Standardized payload structure**:
   ```javascript
   // Ensure property names match exactly what backend expects
   const finalPayload = {
     token: resetData.token,
     password: resetData.password
   };
   ```

2. **Enhanced error handling and debugging**:
   - Added comprehensive request/response logging
   - Improved error message display to show specific issues

3. **Request verification**:
   - Added type checking to ensure correct data types
   - Added existence checking to ensure required fields are present

## Testing the Solution

To verify the solution works:

1. Request a password reset for a test account
2. Use the token from the console logs to access the reset page
3. Enter a new password and submit the form
4. Verify in the console logs that:
   - The token and password are correctly included in the payload
   - The final request payload matches what the backend expects
5. Check that the password reset is successful
6. Verify login works with the new password

## Next Steps

If the issue persists, further investigation would be needed on:

1. **Backend validation**: Review how the backend extracts and validates the password field
2. **Network inspection**: Use browser developer tools to inspect the actual network request
3. **Authentication flow**: Verify token handling and validation on the backend
