# User Forgot Password Implementation Summary

## Implementation Overview

We've implemented a secure, token-based password reset flow for the EHS Learning Platform. This implementation follows industry best practices for security and user experience.

## Backend Components

1. **PasswordResetToken Entity**
   - Stores reset tokens with expiration times
   - Includes validation methods for token expiration and usage status
   - Links to user account via one-to-one relationship

2. **PasswordResetTokenRepository**
   - Manages persistence of reset tokens
   - Provides methods to find tokens by token string or user
   - Supports token deletion for cleanup

3. **EmailService**
   - Handles sending password reset emails with secure links
   - Configurable to work in both production and development modes
   - Supports email-disabled mode for testing without SMTP server

4. **AuthController Endpoints**
   - `/api/auth/forgot-password`: Initiates password reset process
   - `/api/auth/reset-password/validate`: Validates token before password reset
   - `/api/auth/reset-password`: Processes actual password reset with token

5. **Security Configuration**
   - Updated to allow public access to password reset endpoints

## Frontend Components

1. **ForgotPassword Component**
   - Collects user email for reset request
   - Provides clear feedback while maintaining security
   - Designed with responsive UI for all device sizes

2. **ResetPassword Component**
   - Validates reset token before allowing password reset
   - Implements strong password validation rules
   - Clear error and success messaging

3. **API Service Updates**
   - Updated authService methods to interface with new backend endpoints
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

## Security Features

1. **Token-based Authentication**
   - Secure UUID-based tokens
   - 24-hour expiration period
   - Single-use tokens (marked as used after successful reset)

2. **Security Best Practices**
   - Same response for existent and non-existent emails (prevents enumeration)
   - Strong password validation on both frontend and backend
   - Token invalidation when new tokens are requested

3. **Error Handling**
   - Appropriate error messages that don't leak sensitive information
   - Graceful handling of network issues and service unavailability

## Testing

A comprehensive test plan has been created in UserPasswordResetTest.md that covers:
- Happy path testing
- Security test cases
- Edge cases
- Instructions for different testing environments

## Next Steps

1. **Full Integration Testing**
   - Perform end-to-end testing of the complete flow
   - Test with actual email delivery in staging environment

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Add detailed logging for security audit purposes
   - Monitor token usage and reset attempts for security analysis

3. **Enhanced Features (Future)**
   - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attempts
   - Account lockout integration after multiple reset attempts
   - Enhanced analytics on password reset usage
