3. Add subtle shadows and hover effects to cards for depth
4. Use consistent padding (24px) around content areas
5. Clear visual distinction between sections
6. Prominent call-to-action buttons for certificate downloads
7. Use icons sparingly but effectively (download, certificate, completion icons)
8. Ensure typography hierarchy is clear and readable
