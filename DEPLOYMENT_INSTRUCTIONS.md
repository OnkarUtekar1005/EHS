# üöÄ Certificate Fix Deployment Instructions

## **CRITICAL: Certificate Design Fix Deployment**

### **Problem Summary**
The current certificate output doesn't match our HTML template design. The application is generating plain certificates instead of our modern design with blue geometric patterns.

### **Root Cause**
The application needs to be **restarted** with our updated code changes for the openhtmltopdf implementation to take effect.

## **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Verify Changes Are in Place** ‚úÖ
```bash
cd /path/to/EHS/EHS

# Verify template exists
ls -la src/main/resources/templates/certificate.html

# Verify service uses openhtmltopdf
grep -n "PdfRendererBuilder" src/main/java/com/ehs/elearning/service/CertificateService.java

# Verify dependencies are added
grep -A 5 "openhtmltopdf" pom.xml
```

### **Step 2: Clean and Rebuild Application** üîß
```bash
cd EHS

# Clean previous builds
mvn clean

# Compile and package (skip tests for faster deployment)
mvn package -DskipTests

# Or with tests (if you want to run them)
mvn package
```

### **Step 3: Stop Existing Application** üõë
```bash
# Find and kill existing Java processes
ps aux | grep java
pkill -f "EHS"

# Or if using specific port
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
```

### **Step 4: Start Application** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
```bash
# Start the application
java -jar target/EHS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Or if using Spring Boot Maven plugin
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### **Step 5: Verify Template Loading** üîç
**Check application logs for these messages:**
- ‚úÖ `Certificate template loaded successfully. Size: XXXX characters`
- ‚úÖ `Template preview: <!DOCTYPE html>...`
- ‚úÖ No warnings about missing placeholders or shapes

**If you see these warnings, there's still an issue:**
- ‚ùå `Template does not contain {{RECIPIENT_NAME}} placeholder`
- ‚ùå `Template does not contain hardcoded MANISH SHILOTE`
- ‚ùå `Template does not contain blue geometric shapes`

### **Step 6: Test Certificate Generation** üß™
1. **Complete a course** in the application
2. **Generate a certificate** 
3. **Download the PDF**
4. **Verify the new design appears**

### **Expected Results After Fix** ‚úÖ

The new certificate should have:
- ‚úÖ **Blue geometric background shapes** (top-left, bottom-right corners)
- ‚úÖ **Light gradient background** instead of plain white
- ‚úÖ **Professional border** around the certificate
- ‚úÖ **Large stylized "CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT" header**
- ‚úÖ **Golden circular award seal** with "CERTIFIED" text
- ‚úÖ **Modern typography** with proper spacing and fonts
- ‚úÖ **Single signature** for "MANISH SHILOTE - Program Director"
- ‚úÖ **Proper footer** with issue date and certificate number
- ‚úÖ **A4 landscape format** with correct proportions

## **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Certificate Still Shows Old Design:**

1. **Check Template File:**
   ```bash
   cat src/main/resources/templates/certificate.html | head -20
   ```
   Should show HTML with `<style>` and blue background shapes.

2. **Verify Service File:**
   ```bash
   grep -A 10 -B 5 "PdfRendererBuilder" src/main/java/com/ehs/elearning/service/CertificateService.java
   ```
   Should show openhtmltopdf usage.

3. **Check Application Logs:**
   Look for template loading messages and any errors.

4. **Force Clean Rebuild:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean
   rm -rf target/
   mvn package -DskipTests
   ```

### **If PDF Generation Fails:**

1. **Check Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   mvn dependency:tree | grep openhtmltopdf
   ```

2. **Verify Permissions:**
   ```bash
   ls -la uploads/certificates/
   mkdir -p uploads/certificates
   chmod 755 uploads/certificates
   ```

3. **Check for Missing Fonts:**
   The template uses Arial which should be available. If issues persist, try changing to a more basic font.

### **If Still Having Issues:**

1. **Backup Current Template:**
   ```bash
   cp src/main/resources/templates/certificate.html src/main/resources/templates/certificate.html.backup
   ```

2. **Create Minimal Test Template:**
   Replace template with basic version to test if openhtmltopdf is working.

3. **Check Classpath:**
   Ensure template is being packaged correctly:
   ```bash
   jar -tf target/EHS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar | grep certificate.html
   ```

## **SUCCESS VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Template loading messages appear in logs
- [ ] Certificate generation completes successfully
- [ ] PDF contains blue geometric patterns
- [ ] Golden award seal is visible
- [ ] "MANISH SHILOTE" appears as Program Director
- [ ] Professional typography is applied
- [ ] No course instructor field present
- [ ] Proper A4 landscape format

## **FALLBACK PLAN**

If the fixes don't work immediately:

1. **Restart the application** - Most common solution
2. **Clear browser cache** - If viewing certificates in browser
3. **Check file permissions** - Ensure template and upload directories are accessible
4. **Verify Maven build** - Ensure no compilation errors
5. **Contact support** - With specific error messages from logs

## **IMPORTANT NOTES**

- üîÑ **Application restart is MANDATORY** for changes to take effect
- üìÅ **Template must be in correct location**: `src/main/resources/templates/certificate.html`
- üîß **Dependencies must be properly loaded**: Check `mvn dependency:tree`
- üìä **Monitor logs**: They contain crucial debugging information
- üéØ **Test immediately**: Generate a certificate after deployment to verify

**The key to success is ensuring the application fully restarts with the new code!**
