# Course Creation Implementation Plan

## What Has Been Completed

### 1. Flow Documentation
- Created comprehensive flow documentation in `/flow documentations v2/flow.md`
- Created project overview in `/flow documentations v2/project_overview.md`
- Documented all API endpoints, UI layouts, and implementation phases

### 2. Backend Implementation
- Created Course entity (`Course.java`)
- Created CourseComponent entity (`CourseComponent.java`)
- Created CourseRepository
- Created CourseComponentRepository
- Created CourseService with all CRUD operations
- Created CourseController with all REST endpoints
- Created CourseRequest and CourseResponse payload classes

### 3. Frontend Structure
- Created CourseManagement component structure
- Created basic CourseManagement.js with list view
- Added course management route to App.js
- Added course management menu item to admin sidebar

## What Needs to Be Implemented Next

### Phase 1: Course Component Management
1. Create CourseComponentController.java
2. Create CourseComponentService.java
3. Create component request/response payloads
4. Implement component CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Frontend Course Creation Modal
1. Create CreateCourseModal.js
2. Create CourseForm.js
3. Implement basic course details form
4. Add file upload for course icon

### Phase 3: Component Builder UI
1. Create CourseBuilder.js
2. Create ComponentList.js
3. Create ComponentCard.js
4. Implement drag-and-drop reordering

### Phase 4: Assessment and Material Forms
1. Create AssessmentForm.js (for pre/post assessments)
2. Create MaterialForm.js (for learning materials)
3. Create ComponentForm.js wrapper
4. Implement question builder for assessments

### Phase 5: Edit and Clone Functionality
1. Create EditCourseModal.js
2. Implement course loading and editing
3. Handle publish/unpublish restrictions
4. Test clone functionality

### Phase 6: Integration and Testing
1. Connect all frontend components to backend APIs
2. Add error handling and loading states
3. Implement form validation
4. Add success notifications
5. Test all CRUD operations

## Sub-tasks for Next Implementation Sessions

### Session 1: Component Management Backend
- Create CourseComponentController
- Create component payloads
- Implement component service methods
- Test component APIs

### Session 2: Course Creation Modal
- Create modal component
- Build basic course form
- Implement form validation
- Connect to create API

### Session 3: Component Builder
- Create component list UI
- Implement add component buttons
- Create component cards
- Add reordering functionality

### Session 4: Assessment Builder
- Create question form
- Implement MCQ builder
- Implement True/False builder
- Handle multiple questions

### Session 5: Material Upload
- Create material form
- Implement file upload
- Support PDF, video, PPT
- Handle file validation

### Session 6: Complete Integration
- Connect all components
- Test full workflow
- Fix any bugs
- Polish UI/UX

## Technical Considerations

### Backend
- Ensure proper transaction management
- Add validation for all inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Add logging for debugging

### Frontend
- Use Material-UI components consistently
- Implement responsive design
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Handle errors gracefully

### Security
- Validate file uploads
- Check user permissions
- Sanitize all inputs
- Implement rate limiting

## Next Steps

1. Start with Session 1: Component Management Backend
2. Create the CourseComponentController
3. Implement component CRUD operations
4. Test with Postman or similar tool
5. Move to frontend implementation

This modular approach allows the implementation to be continued across multiple sessions while maintaining a clear structure and avoiding confusion.
