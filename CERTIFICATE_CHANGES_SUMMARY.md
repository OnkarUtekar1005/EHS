# Certificate Design Improvements - Summary

## Overview
Updated the EHS Learning Platform certificate generation system to use a modern HTML/CSS template with openhtmltopdf for better design quality and maintainability.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Added OpenHTMLtoPDF Dependencies
- Added `openhtmltopdf-pdfbox` version 1.0.10
- Added `openhtmltopdf-svg-support` version 1.0.10
- These replace the old iText-based PDF generation for better HTML/CSS support

### 2. ✅ Created New Certificate Design Template
- **File**: `src/main/resources/templates/certificate.html`
- **Design**: Modern certificate with blue geometric background patterns (inspired by provided image)
- **Features**:
  - Professional layout with geometric blue shapes
  - Golden award seal in the center
  - Clean typography with proper spacing
  - Responsive A4 landscape format
  - Modern color scheme (blues, golds, grays)

### 3. ✅ Updated CertificateService Implementation
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/ehs/elearning/service/CertificateService.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Switched from iText to OpenHTMLtoPDF for PDF generation
  - Added template loading in `@PostConstruct` method
  - Implemented HTML template processing with placeholder replacement
  - Added comprehensive null value handling

### 4. ✅ Hardcoded Program Director as "Manish Shilote"
- Program Director field now shows "MANISH SHILOTE" (hardcoded as requested)
- No longer dependent on database values or variables

### 5. ✅ Removed Course Instructor Field
- Completely removed the course instructor signature section
- Certificate now shows only one signature (Program Director)
- Updated template layout to center the single signature

### 6. ✅ Enhanced Null Value Handling
- Safely handles null first names and last names
- Defaults to "Certificate Holder" if both names are null
- Handles null course titles (defaults to "Course")
- Handles null certificate numbers (defaults to empty string)

### 7. ✅ Added Test Validation
- **File**: `src/test/java/com/ehs/elearning/CertificateTemplateTest.java`
- Tests template existence and content validation
- Tests placeholder replacement functionality
- Tests null value handling logic

## Template Placeholders

The HTML template uses the following placeholders:
- `{{RECIPIENT_NAME}}` - User's full name (with null handling)
- `{{COURSE_NAME}}` - Course title (with null handling)
- `{{ISSUE_DATE}}` - Certificate issue date (formatted as "dd MMMM yyyy")
- `{{CERTIFICATE_NUMBER}}` - Certificate number (with null handling)

## Certificate Design Features

### Visual Elements

- **Colors**: 
  - Primary blue: #4a5bd6, #3b4ac7
  - Accent blue: #87ceeb, #6bb6d6
