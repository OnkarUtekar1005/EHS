# üö® URGENT: Certificate Design Fix Plan & Execution

## **CRITICAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
The current certificate output shows that our openhtmltopdf implementation is **NOT being used**. The application is still generating certificates with the old system.

## **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**
1. ‚úÖ Our service file contains openhtmltopdf code
2. ‚úÖ Our HTML template exists and is properly designed
3. ‚úÖ Dependencies are added to pom.xml
4. ‚ùå **The application is NOT using our updated code**

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Verify Current State** ‚úÖ
- [x] Confirmed our service uses openhtmltopdf
- [x] Confirmed template exists and has proper design
- [x] Confirmed old iText code is removed
- [x] Issue: Application not using our changes

### **Phase 2: Emergency Fix Implementation** üîß

#### **Step 1: Create Foolproof Template**
The current template might have CSS issues with openhtmltopdf. Let me create a simplified, guaranteed-to-work version.

#### **Step 2: Add Debugging and Fallback**
Add extensive logging to track what's happening during certificate generation.

#### **Step 3: Force Template Reload**
Ensure the template is loaded and used correctly.

- Ensure all positioning works in openhtmltopdf

### **Fix 2: Enhanced Service with Debug Logging**
- Add step-by-step logging
- Verify template loading
- Confirm HTML generation
- Track PDF creation process

### **Fix 3: Deployment Instructions**

- Application restart procedures
- Verification steps

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- ‚úÖ Certificate shows blue geometric background
- ‚úÖ Professional typography and spacing
