Context of the project : an enviornment health safety elearning application with 2 roles 
admin : which has to make training modules, publish them for users, edit them on the go, and manage users while being able to get all the access of most of the application
user : which has to be able to view and complete training modules and see their progress and report
the basic overview of the project is in project overview.md understand that first 
here lies the currently changes that i need for the project
The user when on the login page there is a hyperlink of forgotpassword  now this functionality is not working .U have given me the approach using email to reset password but when user click on the receved email like it direct it to the reset page but when i add the new password it gives mee error-'Error: Password is required' and 400 in the api
Now i want you to analyze the code understand the issue and make a plan to soleve and then make changes
also Note we just need to make chnages where forgotpassword is used we dont need to do chnages in the other parts
now if it is a big task first task you yours is to create comprehenvide plan and create a userforgotpassword plan in a md file
