Context of the project : an enviornment health safety elearning application with 2 roles 
admin : which has to make training modules, publish them for users, edit them on the go, and manage users while being able to get all the access of most of the application
user : which has to be able to view and complete training modules and see their progress and report
dont use flow documentation v1 and v2 they are of no use use v3 that is currenlty that is being used in the project
here lies the currently changes that i need for the project 
Currently we are developing the project and have done a some amount of progress towards the final goals
what has been done now : admin module is functional for some extent, he can add users in bulk and solo, he can get the list of all users with all the passwords for their first login and he can assign domains for them
also in admin modules he can add training modules, edit them, delete them, publish them, takedown them , and get the list of all training modules. Within the training modules there are pre assessment , training content, post assessment. and basic evalutaion
User functionality is to be able to view and complete training modules and see their progress.
understand the project 
Now i can identify a bug at admin level where when adding a course component as pre assessment or post assessment and selecting then selecting the add question option selecting the question type as mutiple choice question and the adding option works but then selecting the correct answer does not wworks
because of which when setting the multipe choice question does not work on user screen when user gives teh assessment
Identify the root casue then look for the files that needs to be modify dont change any other file apart from the identified files or create new unneccessary files create the plan breakdown the issue then move ahead
