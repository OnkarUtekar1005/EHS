Currently we are developing the project and have done a some amount of progress towards the final goals
what has been done now : admin module is functional for some extent, he can add users in bulk and solo, he can get the list of all users with all the passwords for their first login and he can assign domains for them
also in admin modules he can add training modules, edit them, delete them, publish them, takedown them , and get the list of all training modules. Within the training modules there are pre assessment , training content, post assessment. and basic evalutaion
User functionality is to be able to view and complete training modules and see their progress.
