# Progress Service and User Progress Visibility Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Security Configuration
**Problem**: User endpoints were not explicitly allowed in SecurityConfig
**Fix**: Added explicit security rules for user endpoints
```java
// V2 User course endpoints
.requestMatchers("/api/v2/user/courses/**").hasAnyAuthority("ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN")
.requestMatchers("/api/v2/user/progress/**").hasAnyAuthority("ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN")
.requestMatchers("/api/v2/user/assessment/**").hasAnyAuthority("ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN")
```

### 2. Component Access Check
**Problem**: `canAccessComponent` returned false if ComponentProgress didn't exist
**Fix**: Enhanced the method to check enrollment status and create ComponentProgress if needed
```java
// Now checks if user is enrolled and creates progress if missing
if (progress == null) {
    // Check enrollment status
    // Create component progress if enrolled
    // Retry the check
}
```

### 3. Course Enrollment Status
**Problem**: Frontend couldn't tell if user was enrolled in a course
**Fix**: Added enrollment status to CourseResponse
```java
// Added to CourseResponse
private String enrollmentStatus;

// Added to getCourseDetail endpoint
response.setEnrollmentStatus(enrollment.isPresent() ? "enrolled" : "not_enrolled");
```

### 4. Component Progress Initialization
**Problem**: Component progress wasn't automatically created for enrolled users
**Fix**: Enhanced `ensureComponentProgressExists` method usage throughout the service

## Key Changes

1. **SecurityConfig.java**: Added explicit user endpoint security rules
2. **ProgressService.java**: Enhanced `canAccessComponent` to handle missing progress entries
3. **UserCourseController.java**: Added enrollment status to course detail response
4. **CourseResponse.java**: Added enrollmentStatus field with getter/setter

## Visibility Rules

### Course Visibility
- Users can see all published courses
- Users can filter courses by their assigned domains
- Enrollment status is included in course details

### Component Visibility  
- Users must be enrolled in a course to access components
- Pre-assessments are always accessible to enrolled users
- Other components require previous required components to be completed
- Component progress is automatically created when missing

### Progress Visibility
- Users can only see their own progress
- Progress is created automatically upon enrollment
- Component progress is created when component is started

## Next Steps

1. Frontend should check enrollment status before allowing component access
2. Frontend should use `/api/v2/user/progress/courses/{courseId}/enroll` to enroll users
3. Frontend should check component access using `/api/v2/user/progress/components/{componentId}/access`
